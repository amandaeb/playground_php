****connect database****

2.create reuseable sql query functions


****css lessons learned****
1. always put a display type on main-wrap
so that every page can have grid or flex on it
an put content in specific wrap like "general-wrap"
and "form-wrap"

*****PHP security****
1. password encryption:
   $_POST['password'] = password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
2. sql plaintext
  $_POST['body'] = html_entities($_POST['body'])
